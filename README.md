In this project, I'm going to share with some lessons I've learned after few years using Sidekiq as main background processing tool for Ruby projects.

This series of posts was based on my RubyConfBR 2017 talk.

Please visit the [project Wiki page](https://github.com/andersondias/sidekiq-lessons/wiki) for more details.
